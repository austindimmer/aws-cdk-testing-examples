## AWS CDK Testing Examples

This repository contains code examples in Python, Java, and TypeScript for the
Testing CDK Applications in Any Language blog post. These examples use the new
`assertions` module to unit test various parts of a CDK application.

To try these examples out yourself, follow the instructions for your language
in the [Getting started with the AWS CDK developer
guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html), then
run the commands listed in the README.md of the appropriate subdirectory
(i.e. java/, python/, or typescript/).

For more information on the `assertions` module, refer to the [API
reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/assertions-readme.html).
